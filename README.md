Additional Notes:
You may want to set up a MongoDB Atlas cluster if you're using a cloud database.
Use Postman or similar API testing tools to interact with the backend API directly for testing purposes.
If you'd like to deploy the application, you can consider using Heroku or Vercel for hosting the frontend and Heroku for the backend.
